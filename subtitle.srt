13 Creepiest Places In The World

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:13,320
13.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,580
Cat Island
Tashirojima is an island located off the Eastern

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,770
coast of Japan about 200 miles north of Tokyo.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,270
At 1.2 square miles, the island, is slightly
smaller than the size of Central Park in New

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,270
York.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,880
While I’m sure Central Park has some stray
cats, it doesn’t compare to Cat Island,

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,030
as Tashirojima is known, where the cats outnumber
the people 6 to 1.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,739
The reason for the cat mania is the island
was inhabited by people growing silkworms

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,210
and they had cats to catch mice so they couldn’t
eat the silkworms.

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,030
Also cats are believed to be good luck that
will bring money.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,940
Some people believe the cats saved the island
from being destroyed by the 2011 Tsunami.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,710
As you might expect, dogs are not allowed
on the island.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,140
And while cats are cute, when you have 600
of them staring at you, it might get a little

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,140
creepy.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,140
12.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,030
The Skeleton Lake India
Looking for a peaceful vacation by the lake?

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,989
You might want to avoid The Lake of Roopkund,
unless you find scattered human skeletons

19
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,989
relaxing.

20
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,030
Known as skeleton lake, the lake and its disturbing
occupants were originally discovered in World

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,440
W ll by British soldiers who thought they
were the bodies of Japanese troops.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,770
Later testing revealed the remains to actually
be dated to approximately 850AD.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,560
While the mass deaths of the more than 200
people were originally a mystery, scientists

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,370
now believe they were all killed by a single
hail storm, which left the peculiar round

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,360
wounds to the tops of their heads and shoulder
bones.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
11.

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,980
Overtoun Bridge
If you're the kind of person who likes taking

28
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,450
your dogs on vacation with you, then you might
want to avoid Overtoun Bridge in Milton, Scotland.

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,549
Apparently the bridge has an unknown, rather
menacing influence over our furry companions

30
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,070
that causes them to jump off of it, often
to their death.

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,820
The 50ft drop has claimed the lives of at
least 50 dogs in 50 years, with the most deadly

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,730
stretch being a six month period during which
time five dogs leapt to their death.

33
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,450
While scientists who have studied the area
believe the dogs could be jumping in response

34
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,630
to the scent of minks below the bridge, the
theory still leaves many unanswered questions

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,330
such as why all the dogs jump around the exact
same spot - the right side at the least two

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,330
parapets.

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,740
The odd deadly effect of the bridge may not
be particular to canines as in 1994 a local

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,680
man named Kevin Moy killed his baby boy - said
to be only two weeks old - by throwing him

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
off the bridge at about the same spot, saying
he believed the child was the anti-Christ.

40
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,319
10.

41
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,669
Centralia Pennsylvania
Dubbed "one of the creepiest places in the

42
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:33,769
USA", the town of Centralia in Pennsylvania
was once home to over 1,000 people but is

43
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:35,220
now a hazardous ghost town.

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,370
The towns street are blocked to vehicles and
the outskirts plastered with warning signs

45
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,030
telling people to stay out or face possible
death from asphyxiation or from falling through

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,930
the ground into the fiery depths below, as
it was condemned by the government in 1992.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,049
It all started with what was meant to be a
harmless fire set intentionally to burn the

48
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:59,139
towns landfill in 1962, however all did not
go as planned as the landfill was also an

49
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,680
old strip-mine pit that was unfortunately
connected to an intricate maze of underground

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
mining tunnels filled to the brink with coal.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,489
Despite the townsfolk being able to extinguish
the above ground fire, the extensive coal

52
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,169
supply and vast tunnel system have kept the
underground fire burning for 54 years and

53
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,980
there is believed to be enough coal to keep
it going for another 250 years.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,870
While the underground fire did not cause the
townspeople immediate concern, it's dangers

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,620
became apparent when in 1981 a 12 year old
boy fell through a hole that suddenly appeared

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,249
in his back yard and would of certainly died
had a 14 year old boy not been there to quickly

57
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:33,249
pull him out.

58
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:36,489
While there are about a dozen inhabitants
who refuse to leave the dangerous town, the

59
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,689
government plans to bulldoze their houses
after they die in order to prevent future

60
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,689
inhabitants.

61
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,689
9.

62
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,699
Akodessewa Fetish Market in Togo
If you enjoy waking up on a Saturday morning,

63
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,859
grabbing a coffee and taking a nice lingering
walk through your local market, you may want

64
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,170
to stay far away from the Akodessewa Fetish
Market in Lome, Togo where you would almost

65
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,159
certainly be scared from the market experience
for life - literally.

66
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,930
Instead of finding crafts, fresh vegetables
or flowers you'll find "many different kinds

67
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,719
of animal heads" including crocodiles, cats,
monkey's, snakes and numerous kinds of birds

68
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,879
at this market.

69
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,719
Describing what they do at the market for
its customers, a voodoo healer says they will,

70
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,220
'grind up the heads with herbs and then put
the mixture on the fire.

71
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,470
This leaves us with a black powder.

72
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,839
We cut the person's chest or back three times
and then rub the powder into the flesh.'

73
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,840
8.

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,520
Poveglia Island aka Plague Island in Italy
Considered by locals to be the 'most haunted

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,750
place on Earth', few people have set foot
on Poveglia Island since the 1960s.

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,460
In fact, photographer Mike Deere had a hard
time finding a local willing to take him to

77
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,779
the 18 acre island.

78
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,759
When he finally did find a willing local,
he says it cost a significant price and the

79
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,990
apparently brave local man refused to step
foot on the island or even wait there for

80
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,080
him, instead opting to come back in a few
hours to pick him up.

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,389
The reason for this perhaps superstitious
but justifiable behaviour from Venetians,

82
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,860
the islands morbid history.

83
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,150
The island was once used as a quarantine for
people suffering from infectious disease and

84
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,590
became a mass burial site for plaque victims
sent there to be burned.

85
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,991
If that's not gruesome enough, in the 1920's
it then became a mental hospital where, according

86
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:10,800
to locals, a deranged doctor conducted experiments
on patients before taking his own life by

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,919
jumping off the asylum's bell tower.

88
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,919
In total, it's estimated that around 150,000
people died on the island.

89
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,919
7.

90
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,090
Snake Island in Brazil
Even someone who loves snakes wouldn't want

91
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,449
to visit Brazil's Snake Island, Ilha de Queimada
Grande.

92
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:31,680
The 4.6 million square foot island is home
to over 4,000 golden lancehead viper snakes.

93
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,849
With venom five times stronger than that of
other snakes, the golden lancehead viper is

94
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,340
the world's deadliest snake.

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,320
The last inhabitants of the island was the
lighthouse keeper and his family but they

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,680
were all tragically killed by the predators,
their bodies found scattered across the island

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,850
as they presumably were trying to run away
when their house was overtaken.

98
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,750
After numerous human deaths, visiting the
island was banned by the Brazilian government,

99
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,080
with the exception of a few scientists who
have been granted permission to study the

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,430
snakes annually, and the Brazilian navy who
must visit the island on occasion to tend

101
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,789
to the lighthouse.

102
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:03,949
6.

103
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,020
Island of Dolls
A popular attraction for thrill seekers looking

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,550
for a scare is Mexico's Doll Island.

105
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,320
An eerie sight to see, the island is draped
with thousands of sinister looking dolls.

106
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,830
According to the legend of this peculiar decor,
Julian Santana Barrera who was the caretaker

107
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,080
of the island found a little girl drowned
in a nearby canal.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
Shortly after, he found a doll that was presumably
hers and guilt ridden for not having saved

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,110
her, he hung the doll to show her spirit respect
and support.

110
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,189
Haunted by the spirit of the little girl,
Julian claimed to hear her tormented screams

111
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:39,710
and continued to collect dolls and hang them
in the trees to try and please her spirit.

112
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,669
According to the Isla de las Munecas (Island
of Dolls) website, "After 50 years of collecting

113
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,120
dolls and hanging them on the island, Julian
was found dead, drowned in the same spot where

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,879
the girl had died."

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
5.

116
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,870
Anderlecht Veterinary Surgical School
Known as 'The Horror Labs', an old veterinary

117
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,009
school in Brussels, Belgium which has been
abandoned since 1990 has been described as

118
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,889
something straight out of a horror movie.

119
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,729
While the surrounding buildings have been
sold and developed into luxury apartments,

120
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,370
there still sits one sole derelict building
with gruesome contents.

121
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,240
One British urban explorer who dared to enter
the eerie building known for its animal experiments

122
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,699
said, 'It's like being in some crazed professor's
laboratory containing all manner of grotesque

123
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,520
animal organs and body parts.'

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,889
4.

125
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,970
Jatinga near Assam India
A small scenic village in Assam, India called

126
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,949
Jatinga seems quite peaceful and pleasant
but once a year it becomes a dark and sinister

127
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,949
place.

128
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,040
Every year between September and November
shortly after sunset - between 7 and 10pm

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,520
- hundreds of birds plummet to their death
at the same strip of land which is about 1.5km

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,610
long and 200 metres wide.

131
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,009
Perhaps equally disturbing, are the villagers
themselves who look forward to the annual

132
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:50,610
event and not only attack the birds that survive
the plummet with catapults or bamboo sticks

133
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,699
but also created a festival around the bird
suicides called the Jatinga Festival.

134
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,930
3.

135
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,210
Catacombs of Paris
Deep below the bustling streets of Paris,

136
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,919
below the metro, even below the sewer system
lies 200 miles of eerie tunnels.

137
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,540
The narrow, dark passages are home to the
bones of over six million humans, bones that

138
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,499
fill the walls from top to bottom.

139
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:16,000
Parisiens originally dug the intricate tunnel
system to use the ground materials for building

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,430
the city upwards.

141
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,229
However when the cemeteries became overcrowded
by the 18th century, the stench of dead bodies

142
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:26,430
and outbreak of disease caused by rotting
bodies becoming exposed, gave the tunnels

143
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,440
a new use.

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,299
In 1768 in the dead of night, the bodies were
moved from the cemeteries to the tunnels in

145
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,158
carts covered with cloth, while priests chanted
for the dead as they passed.

146
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,409
The catacombs newest arrivals came during
the Revolution, as those who perished were

147
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,898
taken directly to the deathly tunnels.

148
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,899
2.

149
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,449
Herxheim
Herxheim Germany was apparently a place to

150
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:51,079
stay far away from during the collapse of
the European farming society some 7,000 years

151
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,079
ago.

152
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,079
As archaeologists studied the 7,000 year old
bones found there, they discovered the grotesque

153
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,889
history of the region as it became apparent
to them that the inhabitants of the time participated

154
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,380
in cannibalism.

155
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,410
Apparently not even children or unborn babies
were safe from the horrific fate, as even

156
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,020
their bones showed obvious signs such as "chew
marks" and marks normally found on a butchered

157
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
animal.

158
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,779
It's even likely some of the victims were
spit-roasted.

159
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,620
According to researchers the sheer number
of victims, which is likely around 1,000,

160
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,330
indicates the cannibalism was not a last resort
in times of famine, but rather either done

161
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,080
in victory celebrations after the victims
were killed in war or as a ritual sacrifice

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,810
during which the victims were slaughtered
and consumed.

Aokigahara Forest aka Suicide Forest - Japan
While the name of one Japan forest, Aokigahara

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,949
meaning 'Sea of Trees' seems harmless enough,
the mysterious forest has a much more sinister

166
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,020
reputation as it is known as suicide forest.

167
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,160
While there is a long history of people going
to the morbid forest to commit suicide, the

168
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,959
numbers have gone up drastically in the last
two decades, as it went from about 30 suicides

169
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,570
a year prior to 1990 to 108 by 2004.

170
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,020
Presumably in an effort to decrease the phenomenon,
local authorities have stopped making the

171
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,740
annual death toll public, however police records
for 2010 showed 247 suicide attempts, with

172
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,889
54 of them resulting in death.

173
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:14,500
The deadly forest is now so well known for
its fatalities it is now decorated with signs

174
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,940
aimed at trying to dissuade visitors from
killing themselves.
